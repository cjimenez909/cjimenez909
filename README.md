### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! My name is Claudia Jimenez and I'm a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). 
This summer, I worked as a tech consultant/research intern for Break Through Tech Chicago at Argonne National Laboratory. 
I have also held multiple positions at the Adler Planetarium, including as an undergraduate intern researching light pollution. 
I enjoy programming in Python, and I also have experience in C++ and C. 
I have worked with tools such as Valgrind, GDB, Vim, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, OpenCV, QGIS, and LaTeX.
I am working on launching my career in the science realm, biomedical industry, or research. 
I am interested in quantum computing, quantum sensing, data science, and machine learning. 
Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn!
