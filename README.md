### Hi there 👋
Hello! My name is Claudia Jimenez and I'm a fourth-year student studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). 
In summer 2024, I worked as a tech consultant/research intern for Break Through Tech Chicago at Argonne National Laboratory. 
I have also held multiple positions at the Adler Planetarium, including as an undergraduate intern researching light pollution. 
I enjoy programming in Python, and I also have experience in C++ and C. 
I have worked with tools such as Valgrind, GDB, Vim, Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, OpenCV, QGIS, and LaTeX.
I am interested in quantum computing, data science, data engineering, machine learning, and back-end development. 
Feel free to contact me through LinkedIn!
